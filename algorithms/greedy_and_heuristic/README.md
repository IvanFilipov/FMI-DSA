# [Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) & [Greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) 

## Examples

Heuristic:
* [_Random search_](https://github.com/IvanFilipov/FMI-DSA/blob/master/algorithms/greedy_and_heuristic/random_search.cpp)

Greedy:
* [_Lectures_](https://github.com/IvanFilipov/FMI-DSA/blob/master/algorithms/greedy_and_heuristic/lectures.cpp)</br>
Task: We have lectures with their start-end times.</br>
      We want to attend as many as we can, but we can't be </br>
      at two lectures at the same time ofc. Which should we take? </br>
* [_Prim_](https://github.com/IvanFilipov/FMI-DSA/tree/master/algorithms/graph_algorithms/minimal_spanning_tree/prim)
* [_Kruskal_](https://github.com/IvanFilipov/FMI-DSA/tree/master/algorithms/graph_algorithms/minimal_spanning_tree/kruskal)
